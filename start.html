        <H1>2-Minute Warning</H1>
        <p>A game by Henry Kiley.  Dodge the defenders and score touchdowns using the Arduino joystick.  If you would like the audio to play, remember to disable source mapping in your browser's developer settings.  On Chrome, you may also have to add the game page to the list of sites you allow to play sound automatically.</p>

        <p>This game was made for Jesse Allison's Programming Digital Media class at Louisiana State University in the spring of 2022.  It combines aspects of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and (if you use an Arduino) C++.  The project can be played with just the use of the up and down arrow keys, or with a basic Arduino controller.</p>
        <p>You play as intrepid football running back Max Millions, renowned All-American and the newest star of College University's football team.  You've just caught a pass from your QB wide open and are looking to take it to the house.  But watch out!  The opposing team, University College, is sending their safeties after you!  Duck and dodge them to make the touchdown and go for the highest score possible!</p>

        <p>Note: If using an Arduino controller, remember to initialize P5Serial and plug it into the SECOND USB port if you're on an M1 Mac computer.  If you're on Windows, contact the dev at hkiley1@lsu.edu for help.</p>
