        <H1>2-Minute Warning</H1>
        <p>A game by Henry Kiley.  Dodge the defenders and score touchdowns using the Arduino joystick.  If you would like the audio to play, remember to disable source mapping in your browser's developer settings.  On Chrome, you may also have to add the game page to the list of sites you allow to play sound automatically.</p>
        <p>Special thanks to Austin Franklin, Matthew Bardin, Dylan Burchett, Kenny Gornor, Dr. Edgar Berdahl, and Dr. Jesse Allison for making this possible.  Love y'all!</p>

        <p>This game was made for Jesse Allison's Programming Digital Media class at Louisiana State University in the spring of 2022.  It combines aspects of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and (if you use an Arduino) C++.  The project can be played with just the use of the up and down arrow keys, or with a basic Arduino controller.</p>
        <p>You play as intrepid football running back Max Millions, renowned All-American and the newest star of College University's football team.  You've just caught a pass from your QB wide open and are looking to take it to the house.  But watch out!  The opposing team, University College, is sending their safeties after you!  Duck and dodge them by using the up and down arrow keys to make the touchdown and go for the highest score possible!</p>

        <p>Note: If using an Arduino controller, remember to initialize P5Serial and plug it into the SECOND USB port if you're on an M1 Mac computer.  If you're on Windows, contact the dev at hkiley1@lsu.edu for help.</p>
        <p>Will 2MW change in the future?  Hard to say.  With how busy I can get, it's often hard to find time to work on passion projects like this.  That having been said, there are some changes I'd like to make if I can.  Maybe a more elaborate soundtrack with influences from popular NFL TV themes, (the current one is inspired by the hockey arena classic "Brass Bonanza") customizable jersey and helmet colors, more fluid animations, and maybe even a leaderboard.  But time will tell...</p>
